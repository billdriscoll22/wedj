				<h2>Why should I use WeDJ?</h2>
				<p>
					WeDJ turns the act of creating a playlist into a collaborative experience.  
					Rather than putting the burden of choosing songs on the host, WeDJ allows everyone
					present to suggest and vote on songs that play throughout the party.
					This allows the playlist to constantly evolve to fit the taste and mood of the
					partygoers.
				</p>
				<h2>How do I create a party?</h2>
				<p>
					Just choose a party name and type it in the "Create a new party" section on the home page.
					Your party will be created and you will automatically get sent to the playlist page for your new party.
					Now all you need to do is tell your friends the name of your party so they can start adding songs!
				</p>
				<h2> What if my friend already created a party?</h2>
				<p>
					You need to join your friend's party in order to contribute to the playlist.  You can either choose "Browse nearby parties",
					which will list all the parties near your current location, or you can type in the name of the party your're looking for if you know its exact
					name.
				</p>
				<h2> Okay, I joined a party.  Now what? </h2>
				<p>
					You should be able to see the list of suggested songs in the playlist along with the currently playing song. 
					If you're the host, you have the power to play, pause, and adjust the volume on the currently playing song.
					If you have an opinion about any of the songs on the playlist, press the arrow buttons on the right
					to upvote or downvote the song.  The resulting rating for the song is displayed next to the arrows, and 
					when the current song finishes, the song with the highest rating gets played next.
				</p>
				<h2> The song I want to hear isn't on the playlist. How do I add it? </h2>
				<p>
					Click the big "Add Songs" button at the top of the playlist page.  If you know the artist or song you're looking for,
					type the name into the search bar.  If not, just browse the songs that are available by checking out the different
					genres under "Browse songs by genre".  If a song appears grayed out, that means it's already been added to the playlist.  
					When you find a song you want to add, just click on it and it will immediately get added.  When you're done adding as 
					many songs as you'd like, click "Back" in the upper lefthand corner to go back to the playlist.
				</p>
				<h2> Awesome.  But I can't decide what songs to start with! </h2>
				<p>
					We suggest Some Chords (Deadmau5) and Love Story (Taylor Swift).  Guaranteed crowd pleasers.
